# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Python)

This project is complete

[The document I made, explaining some of the math behind the Ray Tracer](Final Math IA.pdf)


If I were to do this project again:
1. Not use Python (it's incredibly slow)
2. Just do more, this Ray Tracer is incredibly basic
3. Maybe try making one in OpenGL, experience with libraries used in the actual CS field, and it would actually render in real time
